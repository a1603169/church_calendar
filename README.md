## Issues

- CORS
- UI Design is not satisfied yet

## Things I want to update

- UI design
- By using strapi to build a locations & schedules of churchs or any church location library, when users click the date to see the church events, I would like the users to get the information of nearest church's information.

## Things I learned

- Basic http Request
- CORS issue
- UseEffect Hook (Side effect logic)
- data filtering 
- moment library for adjusting date's form for calling specific api url
